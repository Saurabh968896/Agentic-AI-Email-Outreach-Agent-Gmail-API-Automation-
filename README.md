**🚀 Agentic AI Email Outreach Agent
Gmail API-Based Intelligent Automation System**

An autonomous Agentic AI-powered email automation system that reads, classifies, drafts, and sends structured outreach emails using the Gmail API.
Designed to simulate a smart professional communication assistant.

**📌 Problem Statement**

**Manual email outreach is:**
Time-consuming
Inconsistent in tone
Hard to track
Difficult to scale

**This project builds an Agentic Email Automation System that:**

Classifies intent
Generates structured responses
Sends automated or semi-automated replies
Logs and tracks communication

**⚙️ Key Features**
✔ Gmail OAuth authentication
✔ Automated inbox scanning
✔ Rule-based + AI-assisted classification
✔ Context-aware email drafting
✔ Template-based response engine
✔ Modular design for scalability
✔ Logging & tracking system
✔ Automation-ready (scheduler compatible)

**🤖 Agentic Workflow Logic**

**The system follows an autonomous agent loop:**
1️⃣ Authenticate
2️⃣ Fetch new emails
3️⃣ Analyze content
4️⃣ Classify intent
5️⃣ Generate response
6️⃣ Send reply
7️⃣ Log activity

The main.py acts as the central orchestration agent.
